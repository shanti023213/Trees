1. L followed by R in any traversal. 
	IN Order   - LNR (N - Root Node)
	Pre Order  - NLR
	Post Order - LRN
2. Any problem can be done by using either PreOrder or PostOrder or Inorder. 
   Identify the problem and try to figure out which traversal fits.
3. remember pre and post and in order code handy
4. Tree traversal space and time complexity is O(N).
5. No of binary trees possibled unlabled  -2nCn/n+1 . if its labled - (2ncn/n+1)*n!.
6. How to get unique binary tree -  (pre or post) and inorder traversals
7. In order traversal of a binary search tree gives elements in sorted order
8. Usually BST contans unique numbers as BST is used to store primary keys. 
   But again it depends on how ever we want to use it.
9. gven pre-order traversal of a BST find inorder traversal.
